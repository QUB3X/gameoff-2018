# Gameoff 2018

## Required Tools

- **[Unity](https://unity3d.com/)** ~~2018.2.16f1~~ ~~2018.2.16f1~~ 2018.2.17f1
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** or **[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)**
- **[Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/)** or **[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)**

## How to propose changes

- First, go to the [project page](https://github.com/QUB3X/gameoff-2018/projects/1) and see if someone has already proposed the same thing.
- Fork this repository with the "fork" button.
- Clone your new fork repository on your PC.

### Make edits
- First, make sure to be up to date with the **upstream repository**, with `git status`, `git pull ` or on *Github Desktop* with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd>. More info [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
- Then, supposing you are on the branch *'master'*, create a new branch from your current state of master with `git checkout -b name-of-new-branch`, replacing *name-of-new-branch* with a _meaningful_ name.
- When you're done, add the changes with `git add *` followed by `git commit -m "Describe here the changes you've done"` or by writing a summary in *Github Desktop*.
- Then push the changes with `git push` or with the push button. (Git may say something about creating a new branch of the remote server).
- When your contribution is complete, go to [Github.com](https://github.com) and make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
